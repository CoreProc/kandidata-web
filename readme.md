# KandiData 

A data-driven webapp for Twitter metrics for the Philippines Election 2016 presidential candidates. It's targeted mainly towards the presidentiables themselves and their campaign managers to check the effectiveness of their campaign through analysed Twitter data. The system primarily checks for the candidate's official hashtags and their mentions and the results are analysed individually using AlchemyAPI and AzureML's Text Analysis API service. The results are then presented in an interactive form using fancy charts and uhh, charts. Lol. 

Built with love, Starbucks coffee, RedBull, Coke, and Amber's.
